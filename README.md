# **FetchView**

FetchView is a simple yet effective demonstration of how to use the JavaScript Fetch API to retrieve and display data from an external API in a dynamic and user-friendly way. This project serves as a starting point for beginners looking to understand how to work with asynchronous data fetching, DOM manipulation, and client-side API integration using vanilla JavaScript.

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

In modern web development, real-time data fetching from external APIs is a core skill. FetchView exemplifies the basic principles behind making HTTP requests to RESTful APIs, parsing JSON responses, and rendering the results on a webpage.

The project uses a publicly available API (`jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`) to retrieve sample data and displays it inside a styled container upon a button click.
